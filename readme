==============================
PHP File Upload System (Simple)
==============================

How it Works:
-------------
1. The user opens "index.php" in the browser.
2. The form in "index.php" lets the user select a file to upload.
3. When the form is submitted:
    - The file is sent to "upload.php" using POST method.
    - "upload.php" checks:
        a. If the "uploads" folder exists (creates if not).
        b. If the file already exists (prevents overwrite).
        c. If the file type is allowed (jpg, png, jpeg, gif, pdf).
        d. If the file size is smaller than 5MB.
4. If all checks pass:
    - The file is moved from temporary storage to the "uploads/" folder.
    - A success message is shown.
5. If any check fails:
    - An error message is shown.

Folder Structure:
-----------------
file_upload_project/
 â”œâ”€â”€ index.php        --> The upload form page
 â”œâ”€â”€ upload.php       --> The file upload handling script
 â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/         --> Where uploaded files are saved
 â””â”€â”€ readme.txt       --> This explanation file

Notes:
------
- Only JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, and PDF files are allowed.
- Maximum file size is 5MB.
- You can customize allowed file types and file size inside "upload.php".
- Always keep file uploads secure by validating files properly.
- If you change max file size in PHP, update "php.ini" settings too.

Enjoy uploading files! ðŸš€
